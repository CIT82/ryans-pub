## How does the internet work?
### Circuit Switching
- Central geographic location routing from point A to point B
- ARPANet = A network of computers that communicated with each other in real time
- *first actual intended use of the internet was military specific*
### Package Switching
- Information sent as a packet in any order that could split up to find the most efficient route to its destination
- This turned out to be a failed early attempt but would lay the ground work for how the internet would communicate in the future
### Modern Internet
- TCP = packages and labels the information from whatever application you're using
- IP = the reliable address information is sent and received from
- DNS = corrolates a domain or label of website instead of the actual ip address associated with the site
- HTML = Hypertext Markup Language which is used to create pages to be displayed on the internet
- HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol allows you to get information from linked resources across the internet
- URI = Uniform Resource Identifier is a unique address to identify each resource across the internet AKA URL
