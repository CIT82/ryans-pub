## CSS

- My most basic understanding of CSS is how it lets you intigrate specific styles within HTML that would otherwise be impossible or just much harder to do.  The mixtures and creativity seems nearly endless through CSS while HTML has its own limits within it's language.  Also it allows your styles to be shortcut through CSS and you don't have to apply what you want every single time with a lengthy amount of code.

## Review
- mdn display
    - The display CSS property determines the type of rendering box used for an element and how it behaves in the document layout. It controls whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and dictates the layout used for its children, like flow layout, grid, or flex. Key uses of the display property include setting elements as block, inline, flex, grid, or none, each affecting how elements are positioned and interact with other elements in the layout.

### Frustration definately won the day here.  I couldn't for the life of me resize the images because they are huge and the spacing within my site are terrible but I am learning.
